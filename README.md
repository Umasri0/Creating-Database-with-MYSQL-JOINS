Creating EMPLOYEE,EMPLOYEE DEPARTMENT,OFFICE LOCATIONS Tables and inserting values by using a few MYSQL Commands.

ðŸ”·Using MYSQL Commands and Data types for creating an Employee Table.

1. CREATE DATABASE â€” creates a new database.

2. CREATE TABLE- creates a new table.

3. USE â€” selects a simple database and then performs operations on it using the in-built commands.

4. INSERT INTO â€” inserts new data into a database.

5. INT â€” Integer numerical (no decimal).

6. VARCHAR â€” data type stores variable-length character strings.

7. INNER JOIN â€” selects records that have matching values in both tables.

8. REFERENCE keyword â€” Is used to define which table and column is used in a foreign key relationship.

9. AUTO INCREMENT â€” allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table. Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.

10. NOT NULL â€” If you do not want a column to have a NULL value, then you need to define such a constraint on the column specifying that NULL is now not allowed for a specific column.

11. A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

12. A PRIMARY KEY is a field in a table that uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.

13. LEFT OUTER JOIN (or) LEFT JOINâ€” this type of Join would fetch all the rows (including NULL values) from the table which is on the left side of the JOIN query.

14. RIGHT OUTER JOIN (or) RIGHT JOINâ€” in this type of Join all the records that do not match from the right table are returned with NULL values on the columns for the left side table.

15. UPDATE â€” the statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

16. ALTER TABLEâ€” the statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

17. CROSS JOIN â€” It produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table.

18. SELF JOIN â€” It is a join in which a table is joined with itself especially when the table has a FOREIGN KEY which references its PRIMARY KEY.

19. SET command â€” is used with UPDATE to specify which columns and values should be updated in a table.
